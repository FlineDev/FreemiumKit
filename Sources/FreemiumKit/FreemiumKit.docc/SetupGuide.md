## Adding the SDK

1. Open your app project in Xcode.

1. In the "File" menu select "Add Package Dependencies…"

   // TODO: add screenshot

1. Paste this to the top right text field and press "Add Package":
   ```
   https://github.com/FlineDev/FreemiumKit.git
   ```

   // TODO: add screenshot

1. Select your app target (if not already selected) and confirm by pressing "Add Package"
   
   // TODO: add screenshot


## Configuring the SDK

1. Make sure your app's Asset Catalog contains the `Paywall.config` file from the "Setup" tab for your app in FreemiumKit. If it doesn't, drag & drop it to your Asset Catalog now.

1. Add a call to `.environmentObject(FreemiumKit.shared)` to every scene in the app entry point. For example:

   ```swift
   @main
   struct MyApp: App {
      var body: some Scene {
         WindowGroup {
            MainView()
         }
         .environmentObject(FreemiumKit.shared)
      }
   }
   ```


## Showing the Paywalls

1. (Recommended) Lock your paid features for users who have not made a purchase yet by using one of the built-in views `PaidFeatureButton` or `PaidFeatureView`. For example:

   ```swift
   // opens paywall if user has not purchased, else works like a normal (stylable) button
   PaidFeatureButton("Export", systemImage: "square.and.arrow.up") {
      // your export logic – no check for a paid tier needed, only called if already purchased 
   }

   // this one behaves exactly the same as the one above, but gives you more flexibility to change the unlocked/locked views
   PaidFeatureView {
      Button("Export", systemImage: "square.and.arrow.up") {
         // your export logic – no check for a paid tier needed, only called if already purchased
      }
   } lockedView: {
      Label("Export", systemImage: "lock")
   }
   ```

   Note that both `PaidFeatureButton` and `PaidFeatureView` accept an `unlocksAtTier` parameter of type `Int` (default: `1`) and a `showPaywallOnPressIfLocked` parameter of type `Bool` (default: `true`). This leads to a default behavior of unlocking the feature only if tier 1 is purchased and showing a paywall on press if tier 1 is not yet purchased. If `showPaywallOnPressIfLocked` is set to `false`, the locked view will not have any automatic interaction, just rendering locked view state as-is without any added behavior.
   

1. (Optional) Alternatively, if you want to control the presentation of the paywall manually, you can add the `.paywall(isPresented:)` modifier to your custom views where needed. For example:

   ```swift
   struct MyView: View {
      @State var showPaywall: Bool = false

      var body: some View {
         Button("Unlock Pro") {
            self.showPaywall = true
         }
         .paywall(isPresent: self.$showPaywall)
      }
   }
   ```

   If you want to conditionally hide views based on paid state (like hiding the unlock button if a user has already purchased), you can add the `FreemiumKit` object as an `@EnvironmentObject` and call `.purchasedTier` on it like so:

   ```swift
   struct MyView: View {
      @EnvironmentObject var freemiumKit: FreemiumKit
      @State var showPaywall: Bool = false

      var body: some View {
         if self.freemiumKit.purchasedTier == nil {
            Button("Unlock Pro") {
               self.showPaywall = true
            }
            .paywall(isPresent: self.$showPaywall)
         }
      }
   }
   ```

1. (Optional) There's also a `PaidStatusView` which you can add to your app's settings to indicate to users what their current purchase state is. There are two styles:

   ```swift
   PaidStatusView(style: .plain)
   PaidStatusView(style: .decorative(icon: .laurel))
   ```

   // TODO: add screenshot of both styles

   The `.decorative` style has multiple `icon` parameter options and also accepts optional `foregroundColor` and `backgroundColor` parameters if you need to adjust the defaults. Note that the `PaidStatusView` will automatically open a paywall on press if there's no purchase yet. Else, it's rendered as just a label without interaction.


## SwiftUI Previews

For SwiftUI previews to work for views where you make use of the `.paywall` modifier, add a call to `.environmentObject(FreemiumKit.preview)` in your preview code like so:

```swift
#Preview {
   YourView()
      .environmentObject(FreemiumKit.preview)
}
```

If you want to simulate a specific paid state in your previews, you can call the `withDebugOverrides(purchasedTier:)` function on `FreemiumKit.preview` and set your desired tier (set `1` for full access). The default `FreemiumKit.preview` shows in the "nothing purchased" state, showcasing how things will look from a Free user perspective. For example:

```swift
#Preview("Full Access") {
   YourView()
      .environmentObject(FreemiumKit.preview.withDebugOverrides(purchasedTier: 1))
}
```
